Module 6 - Python-API Challenge Assignment

Description:

PART 1 = WeatherPy

This assignment involved creating a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. I used the citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Observations and Insights:

Scatter plots were created showcase the following relationships:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Linear regressions were calculated for each relationship analyzing the Northern and Southern Hemispheres:
- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

PART 2 = VacationPy

This assignment involved using the data that was generated from WeatherPy to identify locations that display my ideal weather considerations in regards to temperature, wind speed and cloudiness. Once I identified these locations, I used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates.

Support Received:

I reviewed the lectures, utilized Xpert Learning Assistance on the Bootcamp site, W3 Schools, and YouTube.
